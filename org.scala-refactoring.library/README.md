# Readme

This is a branch by Hanns Holger Rutz, forked off the main-line Scala-Refactoring. The purpose is merely to publish an independent artifact

    "de.sciss" %% "scalarefactoring" % "0.1.0"

Which is taken from mainline v0.6.2-SNAPSHOT. This artifact is used in the ScalaCollider-UGen project and should probably not be used anywhere else.
For example, not all refactoring tests succeed in this version (2 are failing).
